I hold a keen interest in emerging technologies and how innovation in the business world shapes these technologies and the spaces around us on a daily basis. 

I'm passionate about exploiting data to help businesses generate actionable insights that directly influence financials. I'm currently interning at one of the world's largest digital banks, N26, as a Business Operations Analyst in the Acquire semgent.

When I'm not working or studying, I enjoy playing competitive chess, cooking, reading about human behavior and business psychology, and have recently delved into video editing.
